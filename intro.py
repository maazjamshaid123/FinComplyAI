    st.info("FinComplyAIâ„¢ can be described as an advanced financial analytics tool that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to analyze financial transactions for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes. The software works by taking a dataset of financial transactions, which is first processed through a web application that allows users to modify and customize the dataset according to specific parameters. This tailored dataset is then analyzed by a proprietary AI algorithm, which uses the OpenAI GPT model to interpret the data and assess it for potential AML risks, red flags, and other irregularities.")
    st.error("The AI analyzes the overall transactional activity, breaking it down into various categories and sub-categories, evaluating the reasonableness of high-risk transactions against the nature of the client's business, and assessing counterparty risk. This not only includes an analysis of the transactions themselves but also a comprehensive counterparty analysis, which assesses the risk associated with each counterparty involved in the transactions.")
